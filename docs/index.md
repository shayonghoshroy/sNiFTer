sNiFTer is an information platform, with the goal to decrease the learning curve, increase engagement, and provide reliable, actionable information for the NFT space. sNiFTer aims to tackle this challenge on 3 fronts; insights and tracking into the performance of and engagement with an NFT entity, interactive educational resources on NFT and blockChain technology, and interaction between users in a social manner for community engagement. By NFT entity, we are referring to an individual token, an NFT collection, or an NFT creator.

Insights and tracking into the performance of, and engagement with, an NFT entity are provided through features that allow users to view the historical and current sales performance and transaction events associated with an NFT entity, along with community engagement on social sites. This is achieved through NFT entity search, NFT entity current and historical sales performance, transaction history, and beautiful artwork that drives the marketplace. Finally, users can track the events associated with an NFT entity through watch lists that provide current sales information and notify of transactions or upcoming airdrops. Interactive educational resources, presented in a story-like style, with quizzes after short videos, allow users to learn relevant technical information in bite-sized pieces.

The homepage of our site is designed to introduce users to popular NFTs and collections, as well as our design philosphy (sleek and minimal). It displays some of the most popular NFTs indexed by our site in a neat grid like container.

## News

sNiFTer features a news section that offers viral tweets from top creators and minds in both the NFT and blockchain communities. Many people in the NFT community use Twitter trends as a primary source for trends and investments. Our site pulls fresh tweets from a long and everexpanding list of creators each day. Users can filter these by searching with a dropdown menu, with filtered topics such as NFTs, creators, currency, and blockchain networks. Since the tweets are embedded, users can quickly turn to twitter pages and feeds offsite if they are interested in looking at replies or further tweets from creators.

## Search

Our site also features robust search functionality designed to make it easier than ever for users to interact and sort through the world of NFTs. 

Users can search through our database of NFTs using a variety of filters, including collection names, token names, owners, number of sales, and a specific address and accompanying token number.

Our search functionality also offers predictive user input for collection names, allowing users to quickly find collections they were looking for, or even ones they weren't fully aware of.

## Viewing NFTs

![nftview1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59932579/164490990-da2cad39-3adc-4a59-bbe7-70ca981f01b5.png)

Users can select an NFT from the home page or from the search page by clicking on it, allowing them to recieve detailed information about that specific NFT and collection. Users can view the current owner of an NFT or the traits that this particular token has, with trait incidence information also provided. Users can also like NFTs for future use on their profile, or even add them to a watchlist to recieve emails about the NFT.

![nft view 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59932579/164491008-1e100d67-9c50-4929-b324-dbaeb606df04.png)

This page also offers broad transaction data in the form of statistical information. Furthermore, users can monitor each transaction of the NFT from wallet to wallet using the 'Table' option, or they can even view an interactive graph of price history for the token using the 'Chart' option.

![nftview3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59932579/164491015-70a8b95a-d905-480e-be26-9439c18f1342.png)

Further collection info, including a description of the overall collection, its creators and website, logos, and wallet addresses is also displayed. Users can also observe and filter overall incidence of traits in the collection using the "traits" dropdown on this page, allowing them to see beyond the traits present on the individual token.

![nftview4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59932579/164491270-3da2278e-9b7f-4140-9fbf-8d5103ae7fb2.png)

Finally, users can view price and supply statistics for the collection as a whole, with valuable info such as floor price, total volume, total sales, number of owners, and more. They can also view statistics related to the collection over specific time periods, such as months, weeks, or even days. The vast amount of information related to transactions of the specific NFT, as well as its collection, should make it much easier for collectors to make wise investment decisions. Logged in users can also write reviews for NFTs and provide ratings, with the option to submit located at the bottom of this page.

## Wiki

Although users can take quizzes while logged out, additional functionality is implemented for logged in users. Our website tracks completion of articles and awards points to users upon the first time a quiz is completed while logged in. Should a user fail a quiz, they will be provided the ability to restart and earn their points. Users can also return to the home page after completing their quiz without having to scroll to the top for our main navbar.
